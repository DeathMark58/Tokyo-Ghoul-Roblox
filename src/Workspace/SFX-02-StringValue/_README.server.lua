	Audios are provided as "StringValues". This is to prevent the game from suffering lag as hundreds of sounds get downloaded and cached.

	This is a pack of most of the audio I've uploaded - omitting a few awful ones - hastily sorted into an array of categories.
	I recommend experimenting with all the sound effects you use, either by pitching up/down in increments of 0.1 or adding audio effects.
	Often, sound effects can be improved drastically or re-purposed for other reasons with a pitch change.
	Alongside this, I've made a tiny little guide to finding more audio.
	
	
	A short guide on finding good sound effects:
	Using the audio filtering tools provided by the Studio toolbox, one can find plenty of high quality audios.
	
	When searching for audio in the toolbox, simply hit the three lines in the top right to open the filter menu.
	Then, set the maximum sound length to 10 seconds or so.
	This filters out all the music and unnecessarily long audios.
	
	When searching for a specific sound, try every keyword - and synonyms of those keywords - that you can think of.
	For example, let's say you're looking for cloth moving; you could search "cloth rustle", "cloth move", "cloth drag", "movement", "shuffling".
	Or, concrete scraping - "concrete scrape", "rock scrape", "concrete friction", "rock friction", "concrete pull", "rock pull".
	Maybe magic - "magic cast", "magic spell", "magical", "casting", "charging", "spell", "curse", etc.

	It's *that* simple. I've been able to find a decent bunch, and I've included some of them here in a subfolder.
	Hope this helps to anyone looking for audios.
	
	
	Note: The SFX in the "_Random-Library" folder were NOT uploaded by me;
	they are the audios I found in the toolbox and added as an example of what can be found with filtering.
	To find the original author, type "roblox.com/library/AudioIdHere/hdsf" and replace 'AudioIdHere' with the sound's SoundId.
	This will take you to the audio's page on roblox, letting you add the audio to your inventory, favourite it, comment, view the uploader, etc.
